          <p className="mt-8">
            The Kusama OpenGov model works in a way where 1x token = 1x vote.
            Once the vote is cast the tokens are locked up for a certain
            duration, and if the user chooses to do so for longer, the power of
            their vote can increase up to 6 times. Mind you;{" "}
            <span className="underline">staked</span> tokens can also be used to
            vote - which increases their utility.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8">
            The treasury has multiple tracks, but the ones relevant to you are:
          </p>

          <ol className="mt-8">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">1. Small Spender</span> - up to
              333.33 KSM from the treasury at once.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">2. Medium Spender</span> - up to
              3333.33 KSM from the treasury at once.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">3. Big Spender</span> - up to
              33333.33 KSM from the treasury at once.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p className="mt-8">
            Note: *With further integrations we will also introduce bounties,
            which have been allocated curators and funds for specific types of

            or within <Link href="/dashboard">Ordum</Link>. Once you know how
            much your proposal costs, choose a track. Keep in mind that the
            difficulty of criteria increases proportionally with the amount of
            financing you require.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8">
            If the proponent is not well known in the community then it is
            suggested to break down the project into milestones which can be
            payed out per delivery. With this method you can establish a
            reputation, grow, learn and build up your skills.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8 font-semibold">
            There are 2 main criteria that impact the outcome of your proposal:
          </p>

          <ol className="mt-8">
            <li>
              - the approval rate (the basic voting: AYE-pass, NAY-reject,
              Abstain-neither).
            </li>
            <li>
              - support threshold (the % of all tokens in circulation used on 1
              referenda/proposal).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p className="mt-8">
            Both of these can be visualised as curves that vary per track, which
            drop along the{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">decision period </span>, lasting for
            14 days.{" "}
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8">
            If the proposal is passing, after 14 days it entered a confirmation
            period, whose duration differs per track. This period can be
            shortened if there is a high participation % and high approval
            rate(this is highly uncommon). If the proposal is still passing
            within this period, then it is confirmed and the only thing left to
            wait for is the execution of funds, which usually happens when there
            is a treasury burn(a mechanism in the tokenomics to prevent
            inflation). The proposal can enter the confirmation period multiple
            times, but they are limited per track.

            Below are the curves per track and their submission deposits:
